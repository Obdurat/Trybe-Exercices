## <strong>Introduction to Semantic HTML:</strong> :bulb:
Suppose that, in your day to day software development you need to implement a function that displays the users Photo in the front page of your site, to provide a more personal experience.

Wich HTML tag would you use for that ?

\<img> is a great candidate for that !

Using the \<img> element to display an image gives the much more value to the document as opossed to use a \<div> element for example.

## <strong>Elements block and inline:</strong> :triangular_ruler:
There are a couple of key differences between block elements and inline elements:

* A block element always starts on a new line.

* A block element default width takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

* A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

### <strong>Block Elements in html</strong>

\<address> \<article> \<aside> \<blockquote> \<canvas> \<dd> \<div> \<dl> \<dt> \<fieldset> \<figcaption> \<figure> \<footer> \<form> \<h1>- \<h6> \<header> \<hr> \<li> \<main> \<nav> \<noscript> \<ol> \<p> \<pre> \<section> \<table> \<tfoot> \<ul> \<video>

* An inline element does not start on a new line.

* An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
