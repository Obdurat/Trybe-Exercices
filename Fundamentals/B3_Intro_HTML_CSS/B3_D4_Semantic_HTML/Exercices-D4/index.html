                <h2>
                    Facts about the Mantis Shrimp.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mantis shrimp <i>Odontodactylus scyllarus</i>, or stomatopods, are carnivorous marine crustaceans of
                    the order Stomatopoda,
                    branching from other members of the class Malacostraca around 340 million years ago.[2] Mantis
                    shrimps typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15
                    in).[3] A mantis shrimp's carapace (the hard, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other
                    species) covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties
                    range in colour from shades of brown to vivid colours, with more than 450 species of mantis shrimp
                    being known. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical
                    marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood, as many species spend
                    most of their lives tucked away in burrows and holes.[4]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia,[5] and now sometimes
                    referred to as "thumb splitters"—because of the animal's ability to inflict painful wounds if
                    handled incautiously[6]—mantis shrimps have powerful raptorials that are used to attack and kill
                    prey either by spearing, stunning, or dismembering. Some mantis shrimp species have specialised
                    calcified "clubs" that can strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to seize
                    the prey (hence the term "mantis" in its common name).

                        Despite their namesake and relatively puny stature, mantis shrimp aren’t shrimp at all.
                        (Neither, of course, are they mantises.) They're stomatopods, distant relatives to crabs,
                        shrimp, and lobsters.

                        The peacock mantis shrimp (Odontodactylus scyllarus) uses two appendages called dactyl clubs to
                        pummel its prey like aquatic Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots—that is, if kids’ toys could punch fast
                        enough to boil water and split fingers to the bone. These wrecking ball "fists" spring forth
                        from their bodies at 50 mph, accelerating quicker than a .22-caliber bullet. At those speeds,
                        the water surrounding them briefly reaches the temperature of the Sun’s surface. When the dactyl
                        clubs hit their target, they deliver 160 pounds of force, smashing through shells like a
                        lightning-fast crab mallet.

                        Mantis shrimp come in a variety of species, and we’re aware of about 550 of them. Stomatopods
                        from different species range in size from smaller than an inch to longer than a foot. They’re
                        usually classified by murder method—either smashing, as detailed above, or spearing. In place of
                        dactyl clubs, spearers have two sharp appendages on the front of their bodies built for
                        harpooning prey. Spear-wielding mantis shrimp don’t move as fast as their club-fisted
                        counterparts (their strikes are about 10 times slower), but the threat of death by impalement is
                        intimidating on its own.

                        Peacock mantis shrimp have the most complex set of peepers in the animal kingdom. Each eye
                        contains 12 photoreceptors that allow them to sense different types of color. For comparison,
                        human eyes typically contain three types of light-sensitive cells for seeing red, blue, and
                        green. This has led some to conclude that mantis shrimp perceive the world in a psychedelic
                        rainbow of vibrant color we can’t begin to comprehend. But in reality, the crustaceans are
                        actually worse at differentiating between subtle variations in hue than we are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A study from the University of Queensland found that when mantis shrimp were shown colors with a
                        difference in wavelength less than 25 nanometers, they had trouble telling them apart. But just
                        because mantis shrimp may not see the variations between powder blue and periwinkle doesn’t mean
                        their vision isn’t extraordinary. On the contrary, their optic abilities are on a completely
                        separate level from ours, functioning more like a satellite than anything found in nature.
                        Scientists believe that mantis shrimp take all the visual information they see into their brains
                        at once without processing it, allowing them to react to their surroundings as quickly as
                        possible. Their independently roaming eyes and trinocular vision also make them excellent
                        hunters.

                        In addition to the all epic abilities listed above, mantis shrimp are one of the only creatures
                        capable of seeing polarized light. This has allowed them to develop a secret code that’s
                        undetectable to other species. The Haptosquilla trispinosa species of mantis shrimp wields
                        feathery feeding appendages called maxillipeds that are marked with iridescent, blue spots. The
                        cells of these features reflect light in a unique way. Instead of bouncing light into a
                        reflective structure like the polarizing cells developed by humans, the cells distribute light
                        across the spot’s surface. The brilliant light is plainly visible to other mantis shrimp,
                        allowing them to signal members of their species while staying hidden from predators.
